# Northcoders House of Games API

## Setup
You will need to create two .env files: 

1. .env.test
2. .env.development. 

Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here> as follows: 
* .env.test: PGDATABASE=nc_games_test
* .env.development: PGDATABASE=nc_games

Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
